But mind this: Yours is a black path through the night. When you confront those who lurk in the darkness, you also envelop yourself in it. Good journey, struggler.",
  "We can also determine the end behavior of a polynomial function from its equation. This is often helpful while trying to graph the function, as knowing the end behavior helps us visualize the graph at the \"ends.\"",
  "Breyers was made 62 years before Dreyers was made, and Dreyers was made by William J Dreyers. William J Dreyers was a man of selfishness and greed. He strived to make as much currency as possible, and become a man of wealth. On the other hand, creator of Breyers, William A Breyers was a fine man.
